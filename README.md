# firesave-API
NodeJS API for a people managing service to help in case of a fire

## Initialisation 

You need to change the MySQL database parameters in database.js to fit your setup. 
Ideally you will want to add manually a promotion and then an admin user into your database to get things started (you won't be able to do it through the API).
